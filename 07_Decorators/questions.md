<Summary> 1. Timing Function Execution
<Summary> Write a decorator that measures the time function takes to execute.

<Summary> 2. Debugging Function Calls
<Summary> Create a decorator to print the function name and the values of its argument every time the function is called.

<Summary> 3. Cache Return Values
<Summary> Implement a decorator that caches the return values of a function, so that when it's called with the same arguments, the cached value is created instead of a re-executing the function.
